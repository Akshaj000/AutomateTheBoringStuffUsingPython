8. What do the sheet.max_column and sheet.max_row sheet attributes hold, and what is the data type of these attributes?

it holds an integer value of maximum no of occupied columns and rows in a worksheet.

openpyxl.cell.column_index_from_string('M')

10. If you needed to get the string name for column 14, what function would you need to call?

openpyxl.cell.get_column_letter(14)

11. How can you retrieve a tuple of all the Cell objects from A1 to F1?
