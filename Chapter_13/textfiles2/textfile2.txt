1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?



   True, False or 1,0

   in python we use True or False with  first letter in uppercase.

 

2. What are the three Boolean operators?



   and, or, not

   These are used in boolean expression to return boolean value.

   Eg:

   True or False = True

   True and False = False

   not True = False

   (5>3) and (7<3) = False

   (5>3) or (7<3) = True

   

3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator 

   (that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).



    And

    

    x | y | x and y

    0 | 0 |    0

    0 | 1 |    0

    1 | 0 |    0

    1 | 1 |    1

    

    Or

    

    x | y | x or y

    0 | 0 |    0

    0 | 1 |    1

    1 | 0 |    1

    1 | 1 |    1

    

    Not

    

    x | !x

    0 |  1

    1 |  0

    

4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?



   (5 > 4) and (3 == 5)  = True and False = False

   not (5 > 4)  = not True = False

   (5 > 4) or (3 == 5) = True or False = True

   not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))  = not (True or False) = not True = False

   (True and True) and (True == False)  = True and False = False

   (not False) or (not True)  = True or False = True

   

5. What are the six comparison operators?



   ==   is equal to

   !=   is not equal to

   <    is less than

   >    is greater than

   <=   is less than or equal to

   >=   is greater than or equal to

   

6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?

   

   '=' assigns a value to a variable. ex: a = 5

   '==' checks whether two values are equal. ex: 5==5 prints True

   

7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.



   The code make decisions and carry out actions accordingly depending on conditions.

   We use them we need to exectute some code depending on some condition.

   ex:

   if (a>b):

       print("a is larger") 

   

8. Identify the three blocks in this code:



   1.spam = 0

   2.if spam == 10:

   3.    print('eggs')

   4.    if spam > 5:

   5.        print('bacon')

   6.    else:

   7.        print('ham')

   8.    print('spam')

   9.print('spam')

   

   The main code block containing the whole code from line 1 to 9.

   The first if block containg if, else and print statements.

   The if and else block inside the former if block containing print statement.



9. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, 

   and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam. 

   

   spam=int(input())

   if spam==1:

       print('Hello')

   elif spam==2:

       print('Howdy')

   else:

       print('Greetings!')

         

10. What keys can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?



    ctrl+c

    

11. What is the difference between break and continue?

    

    break is a keyword which breaks or bring the control of program outside the loop.

    continue is a keyword which is used to end  the cureent iteration in a loop and continue to next iteration.



12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop?

    

    for i in range(init,final,step)

    

    for i in range(10)      only final value is specified. Initial value is set to 0 and step value is set to 1  as default 

    for i in range(0,10)    Initial  val and final val is specified. step val is set to 1 as deafult.

    for i in range(1,10,1)

    In all three of the loop i iterates same elements. That is from 0 to 10 , 10 not  included with step value of 1.

    

13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. 

    Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

    

    for i in range(1,11):

         print(i)

        

    i=1

    while(i<=10):

         print(i)

         i+=1

         

14. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam,

    how would you call it after importing spam?

    

    import spam

    spam.bacon()

    

    

15. Look up the round() and abs() functions on the internet, and find out what they do. 

    Experiment with them in the interactive shell.

    

    abs() give absolute value and round() rounds to nearest integer
